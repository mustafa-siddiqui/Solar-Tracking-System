# Solar Tracking System
Sun Tracking PV System for Senior Design.

### Modules
* GPS Receiver
    * receive gps coordinates of the sun and determine direction of movement
* Accelerometer
    * determine the motion of the system and keep track of movement
* Magnetometer
    * >> insert specific role of device for system <<
* Motor Movement & Control
    * send control signals (PWM?) to the DC gear motors for movement
    * covers horizontal (rotation around the z-axis) and vertical (rotation around the y-axis) motion
* System Info
    * Operating info like
        * time since turned on
        * kWhs generated
        * additional sunlight captured (or power generated) as compared to a single solar panel
* User Control (if time and energy permits)
    * Give user the option to turn on/off
    * Control motion of the system

### Dev Setup
>> insert steps for MPLAB x IDE to build project for our target microcontroller << 

### Progress
>> keep track of dev progress as we go <<

### Notes
>> important points to let others know of/keep track of for oneself during development
